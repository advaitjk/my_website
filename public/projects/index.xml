#Introduction
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It’s an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. Let’s say that we are looking to buy a house in Ames, Iowa, and we want to find the best possible house for our price range, so we are going to use different supervised machine learning techniques to actually find how much this property will set us back!</description>

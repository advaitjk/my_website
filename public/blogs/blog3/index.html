<h1>Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<center>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579621970795-87facc2f976d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1400&q=60">
</center>
<p>Objective: In this challenge, we will look at how does the GDP and its components vary over time, and compare different countries. We will pay special attention to how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP.</p>
<p>What is the GDP exactly?</p>
<p>The GDP is the Gross Domestic Product, and its main components are: Personal Consumption (C), Business Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports.</p>
<p>The dataset that we will use is the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of all countries from 1970 to today. This dataset will allow us to look at how each country’s GDP isolated as a function of its factors and as a function of time. Let us begin by first loading the GDP Database.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>UN_GDP_data &lt;- read_excel(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls&quot;), 
               sheet=&quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr&quot;, 
               skip=2) </code></pre>
<p>We know we stress this in every challenge, but as budding Data Scientists, we can’t stress how important it is to tidy up the data. According to the tidy data format, we always always want the dataset to be in longer format instead of wider when the different attributes could simply have been different values of the same column. We will also divide all the figures by 10^9 in order to express all of these hefty figures in billions. We also want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Our mission while performing Data Transformation is to create a tidier dataframe
tidy_UN_GDP_data &lt;- UN_GDP_data %&gt;% 
  # The first step is to transform the data into the longer format
  pivot_longer(cols = `1970`:`2017`, names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;values&quot;) %&gt;% 
  # To express in billions, we will divide the values by a billion
  mutate(values = values / 1e9) %&gt;% 
  # We will now rename all of our indicators using the from and to methods
  mutate(IndicatorName = plyr::mapvalues(IndicatorName, 
        c(&quot;Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)&quot;,
         &quot;General government final consumption expenditure&quot;,
         &quot;Exports of goods and services&quot;,
         &quot;Imports of goods and services&quot;), 
        c(&quot;Household expenditure&quot;,
         &quot;Government expenditure&quot;,

<p>GDP can also be said to be the sum of the Household expenditure, Gross capital formation, Government Expenditure, and net Exports. Now let us calculate the GDP as a function of its components. We will then compare our calculated GDP to the actual GDP that we have in the table.</p>

<p>Original Plot:</p>
<p><img src="/Users/advaitjayant/Downloads/OneDrive%20-%20LBS/Applied%20Statistics/github%20project%203/my_website/images/gdp2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The first line that we see on the plot is Household Expenditure. We can visualize that over the past few decades, the household expenditures in Germany and the United States have stayed more or less the same. The fitting line when it comes to Germany seems to have a slight negative gradient whereas in the case of the United States there is a clear positive gradient. The real surprise comes when we look at the average expenditure in India and how it has dropped considerably over the past few decades; this is a rather surprising phenomenon. This is actually super surprising because it isn’t a phenomenon that is usually talked about in India; a lower household spending indicates a drop in the household’s average purchasing power, which is quite a depressing phenomenon.</p>
<p>The net exports in the United States have been more or less stable in the United States; we can see some times when they did drop for example around 2008, which is right when the housing market collapsed leading to one of the greatest recessions that the country had experienced. This could explain the negative peak around that time. Germany’s trade relations have always been quite excellent and their products have flourished internationally - everyone is familiar with German automobile makers such as Skoda, Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes; German products are renowned and internationally acclaimed as extraordinary products from their vehicles to their heavy machinery: there is therefore no surprise that the net exports can be visualized on an increasing line. India has tried to maintain it’s stability around 0% and the imports have been more than exports for quite a large time in the past few decades. Although there was no recession in India in 2012, we were most definitely hit by a looming and devastating financial crisis, which definitely explains the downward peak around that time in the plot.</p>
<p>The next contributing factor to the GDP that we will look at is the Government expenditure. The government expenditure has been quite stable over the past few decades in both India and Germany. What really surprises us is the USA. The fitting line of the plot of government spending for the USA seems to be declining over the past few decades.</p>
<p>The final factor that we will take a look at is the Gross Capital Formation. The Gross Capital Formationis described as “the acquisition of produced assets (including purchases of second-hand assets), including the production of such assets by producers for their own use, minus disposals”. This is the first time we have encountered this factor but it seems to dilineate investment into the country’s assets. The GCF in Germany seems to be declining and it may be a bit of a cause of concern. The idea behind the GCF as we know from movies is that we generally need money to make money and the core idea behind this way of thought isn’t exactly wrong; so when a country wants to become richer, they usually need to build more factories, newer roads, buy more materials etc. All of these things ost money at the end of the day so the person who gives you the money would expect to be compensated in return - the person investing is an investor. Most countries try to get money from overseas to fund projects within the country and the GCF seems to be a factor which indicates the degree of foreign investment into the country. Germany’s dropping GCF indicates that it won’t be as easy now for Germany to secure funds as it used to be initially. At the same time, countries can also earn more money be investing into other countries; and this aspect also seems to be represented within the GCF; so in no situations is it exactly ideal to have a dropping GCF. Now when we look at India, we know that since the internet came into picture and technology became more accessible, it is easy to discern that India got a lot of foreign investment into the country. During the time of PM Manmohan Singh - a brilliant economist, who was in the Prime Minister’s office from 2004 to 2014, we experienced a clear growth in the GCF, which was mainly caused due to how much easier he made it for foreign investment to come into India, and the scale of the projects that were actually set up during his time were quite immense. This man and his vision were responsible for a vast majority of the reason why millions of jobs were created and India even made it to Mars (this mission is credited to Mr. Modi but as we already know a lot of politicians are known to take credit for actions they had no part in.). The GCF in the US has also been on the experiencing a few drops only during the dot com crash (2001-2002) and the housing market crisis (2008).</p>
<p>Conclusions:
Germany: The net exports are on the rise but the fall of the GCF is something that we would need to look into in a MUCH more detailed and deeper level because this is not a great indicator and may become a cause of concern in the years to come actually. The household expensidure and the government expenditure are quite stable so we wouldn’t really worry about that.</p>
<p>USA: The household expenditure’s gradient is quite steady and positive and we like that. The government expenditure seems to be dropping which could possible and we would need to explore that factor in MUCH more detail to structure our hypothesis on why that seems to be happening. The net exports look fine with negative peaks around the 2008 recession and they look more or less fine to us. The GCF has increased over the past few decades which suggests quite a positive outlook. :)</p>
<p>India: The household expenditures seem to have fallen substantially when the authoritarian BJP leader PM Mr. Modi came into power and we aren’t very optimistic about the policies introduced during his term. We have reason to believe that even though he claims that he has smoothened trade deals and foreign development in India (FDI) agreements, the value of the GCF has actually dropped from what PM Mr. Manmohan Singh had been able to set it to so we aren’t really pleased with what’s happening here. The government expenditures seem to be quite stable, and the net exports have risen during the past 6 years so we will give some credit to our supreme leader for that.</p>
